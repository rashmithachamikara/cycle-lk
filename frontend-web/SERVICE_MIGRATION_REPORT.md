# Service Migration Report

## Environment Configuration and apiUtils Integration

### Date: August 4, 2025

---

## Summary

Successfully migrated all services in the `src/services/` folder to use the centralized `apiUtils` configuration and environment variables from `.env` file.

## Services Status

### âœ… Services Updated to Use apiUtils

1. **faqService.ts** - Migrated from direct axios to centralized api instance
2. **notificationService.ts** - Migrated from direct axios to centralized api instance
3. **paymentService.ts** - Migrated from direct axios to centralized api instance
4. **reviewService.ts** - Migrated from direct axios to centralized api instance
5. **supportService.ts** - Migrated from direct axios to centralized api instance

### âœ… Services Already Using apiUtils (No Changes Needed)

1. **authService.ts** - Already using centralized api
2. **bikeService.ts** - Already using centralized api
3. **bookingService.ts** - Already using centralized api
4. **locationService.ts** - Already using centralized api
5. **partnerService.ts** - Already updated previously

## Changes Made

### For Each Migrated Service:

1. **Import Statement**: Changed from `import axios from 'axios'` to `import { api, debugLog } from '../utils/apiUtils'`
2. **Environment Variables**: Removed direct `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` usage
3. **API Calls**: Updated all axios calls to use the centralized `api` instance
4. **Debug Logging**: Added `debugLog()` calls for better development experience
5. **URL Structure**: Changed from full URLs to relative paths (e.g., `/partners` instead of `${API_URL}/partners`)

### Example Transformation:

```typescript
// Before
import axios from "axios";
const API_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;

const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}/endpoint`);

// After
import { api, debugLog } from "../utils/apiUtils";

debugLog("Fetching data from endpoint");
const response = await api.get("/endpoint");
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Centralized Configuration**

- All environment variables managed through `ENV_CONFIG`
- Single source of truth for API configuration
- Consistent timeout and header management

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**

- Centralized error handling through interceptors
- Automatic token management
- Standardized error formatting

### 3. **Debug Capabilities**

- Environment-controlled debug logging
- Request/response logging in development
- Easy troubleshooting and monitoring

### 4. **Type Safety**

- Full TypeScript support
- Proper error handling types
- Environment variable validation

### 5. **Maintainability**

- Easier to update API configurations
- Consistent code patterns across services
- Reduced code duplication

## Environment Variables Used

All services now benefit from these environment configurations:

- `VITE_API_URL` - Backend API base URL
- `VITE_API_TIMEOUT` - Request timeout
- `VITE_ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE` - Debug logging control
- `VITE_JWT_SECRET_KEY` - JWT configuration
- `VITE_APP_ENVIRONMENT` - Environment mode

## Testing Status

### âœ… Compilation Status

- All services compile without TypeScript errors
- No lint warnings or errors
- All imports resolved correctly

### âœ… Runtime Testing

- Environment variables loaded correctly
- Debug logging working as expected
- API calls using centralized configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing**: Test all services with real API endpoints
2. **Error Handling**: Verify error handling works consistently across all services
3. **Performance**: Monitor request/response times with centralized configuration
4. **Documentation**: Update API documentation to reflect new patterns

## Files Modified

### Services Updated:

- `src/services/faqService.ts`
- `src/services/notificationService.ts`
- `src/services/paymentService.ts`
- `src/services/reviewService.ts`
- `src/services/supportService.ts`

### Configuration Files:

- `src/utils/apiUtils.ts` (enhanced)
- `.env` (created)
- `.env.example` (created)
- `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` (documentation)
