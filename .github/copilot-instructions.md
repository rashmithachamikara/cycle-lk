# Cycle.LK Project Instructions
- This workspace contains a Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend and a Vite/React frontend.
- Use modern best practices for both backend and frontend code.
- Backend API endpoints should be RESTful and use environment variables for configuration.
- Frontend should use React Router for navigation and follow component-based architecture.
- Do not include mobile code unless explicitly requested.
